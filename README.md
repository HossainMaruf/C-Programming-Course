## Arithmetic Problem
- Diameter, Circumference and area of a circle - `Circle.c`
- Diameter, Surface area and volume of a sphere - `Sphere.c`
- Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa - `Temperature.c`

## Operators
- Operators (Assignment, Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Increment/Decrement, Bitwise, Conditional, Special)

## Conditional Control Statement
- `Control Statement` Theory
- `if else` Theory
- Greater/Smaller between two numbers `using if else ladder`
- Greatest/Smallest among three numbers `using logical operator & nested if else`
- Conditional Operator
- Even/Odd and Divisibility Checking of a number
- Leap year or not
- `char` data type
- A character alphabet, digit or special char + Vowel Consonant problem 
- Take input day number and print day name
- Number of notes in given amount in tk
- Take sides of triangle and check the triangle valid or not + Check it is equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle.
- Find roots of quadratic equation 
- Calculate grade and gpa based on marks
- (HW) Number is Positive, Negative or Zero
- (HW) Character is uppercase or lowercase
- (HW) Take  input month number and print month name
- (HW) Take angles of triangle and check the triangle valid or not

- Print natural/even/odd number from 1 to n and n to 1
- Sum of natural/even/odd number from 1 to n
- Print Multiplication Table
- Check a number prime or not 
-  
- `Nested for` loop concept

## Array and String
- Array Syntax, Declaration, Assignment and print result (c89/c90 Staic and c99 Dynamic)
- Loop and Array the perfect bonding (Generally `for` loop)
- `char[]` vs `char*`

## Pointer
- Pointer Theory and Why Pointer
- Pointer Arithmetic 
- `const int*` vs `int* const` vs `const int* const`

## Function
- Theory of Concept Necessity and Syntax
- Recursion (Recursive Function)

## File Handling
- Theory with `fopen()`, `fclose()` and mode of file opening
- Read char by char using `fgetc()` function - `fgetc.c`
- Read full file using `fgetc()` and `while` loop until `EOF(End of File)` - `ReadFile.c`
- Reset file pointer using `rewind()` and get pointer position using `ftelL()` - `rewind_ftell.c`
- Skip Letter using `fseek()` and concept of `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_END` and `SEEK_CUR` - `fseek.c`
- Calculate file size using `fseek()` and `ftell()` functions - `GettingFileSize.c`
- Read fixed size data from line to buffer using `fgets()` function and problem of this function - `fgets.c`
- Read Random Line from same length of lines from a file - `ReadRandomLine.c`
- Save and Restore file pointer using `ftell()` and `fseek()` functions - `SaveReadAndRestoreFilePointer.c`
- Read Random Line from different length of lines from a file (Generic Concept) - `ReadRandomLine2.c`
- Read formatted data using `fscanf()` function - `ReadFormattedData.c`
- Read student data using `fscanf()` and understand the loop hole to use it - `ReadStudentData.c`
- Read formattd data using `fgets()` and `sscanf()` safely instead of `fscanf()` - `ReadStdDataSafely.c`
- Write a char using `fputc()` function - `fputc.c`
- Write data using `fputs()` function - `fputs.c`
- Write formatted data using `fprintf()` function - `WriteFormattedData.c`
