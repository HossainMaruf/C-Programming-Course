# C Programming Course (According to Playlist and Code)

## Loop
- `for` loop syntax with advance concept with code
- `for` loop practical

## File Handling
- Theory with `fopen()`, `fclose()` and mode of file opening
- Read char by char using `fgetc()` function - `fgetc.c`
- Read full file using `fgetc()` and `while` loop until `EOF(End of File)` - `ReadFile.c`
- Reset file pointer using `rewind()` and get pointer position using `ftelL()` - `rewind_ftell.c`
- Skip Letter using `fseek()` and concept of `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_END` and `SEEK_CUR` - `fseek.c`
- Calculate file size using `fseek()` and `ftell()` functions - `GettingFileSize.c`
- Read fixed size data from line to buffer using `fgets()` function and problem of this function - `fgets.c`
- Read Random Line from same length of lines from a file - `ReadRandomLine.c`
- Save and Restore file pointer using `ftell()` and `fseek()` functions - `SaveReadAndRestoreFilePointer.c`
- Read Random Line from different length of lines from a file (Generic Concept) - `ReadRandomLine2.c`
- Read formatted data using `fscanf()` function - `ReadFormattedData.c`
- Read student data using `fscanf()` and understand the loop hole to use it - `ReadStudentData.c`
- Read formattd data using `fgets()` and `sscanf()` safely instead of `fscanf()` - `ReadStdDataSafely.c`
- Write a char using `fputc()` function
- Write data using `fputs()` function
- Write formatted data using `fprintf()` function
